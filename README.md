# Random_Password_Generator

## Description
This is a password generator that allows you to select what type of characters you would like included in your password (uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols).  It will give a length requirement of 8-128 characters; giving the user choice in the length of the password.  A password will be generated on the screen after input.


This project motivated me as a future developer in learning more about JavaScript.  This was my first time working with various functions and methods.  This hands-on-approach helped me to see how individual concepts can work together to make an application.

## Usage

This project can be used to generate random passwords.  A next step could be to add a copy button to make it easier for the user to transfer the password off the page.
